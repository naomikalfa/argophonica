This is a work very much in progress with many to-dos! They are being stored in 'issues'.

**Who we are:**

Argophonica is a music player built in Python using a Django framework and a Postgres database. The database is wired to a browser front-end using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Future functionality will include things like user authentication, payment system integration, and search functionality.
