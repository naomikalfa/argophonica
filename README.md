This is a work very much in progress, with all expected attendant sinkholes, fenced-off & caved-in areas, and 
questionable piles of rubble every which way. And shall we agree to say nothing of those pools of mysterious, glistening liquids from which waft wreathes of sulfuric smoke?

So many to-dos! They are being stored in 'issues', feel free to take a look.

**Who we are:**

Argophonica is a music player built in Python within a Django framework and using a Postgres database. The database is wired to a browser front-end using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Future functionality will include things like user authentication, payment system integration, and search functionality.
